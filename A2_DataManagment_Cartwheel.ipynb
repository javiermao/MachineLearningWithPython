The **Pandas** library was developed to meet this need. **Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course. **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n","\n","The main data structure that **Pandas** works with is called a **Data Frame**. This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically\n","represent cases and the columns represent variables (e.g. data used in this tutorial).  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n","\n","Pandas has a variety of functions named `read_xxx` for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading `csv` files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include `excel`, `json`, and `sql`. \n","\n","There are many other options to `read_csv` that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for `read_csv`.\n","\n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","- The dataset used in this tutorial is from https://www.coursera.org/ from the course \"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python\" by University of Michigan\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b9FN-daXhjjT"},"source":["# Importing libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"uRwVhX-YhjjU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679356244931,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":215,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the packages that we will be using\n","import pandas as pd                 # For data handling\n","\n","#pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 100) # Show all columns when looking at dataframe"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MbGKgakihjjg"},"source":["# Importing data"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define where you are running the code: colab or local\n","RunInColab          = True     # (False: no  | True: yes)\n","\n","# If running in colab:\n","if RunInColab:\n","    # Mount your google drive in google colab\n","    from google.colab import drive\n","    drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","    # Find location\n","    #!pwd\n","    #!ls\n","    #!ls \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    Ruta            = \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","else:\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    Ruta            = \"\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tNHPKB8pbRRC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679356246005,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":917,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}},"outputId":"939c0c8c-6def-4a28-e37c-fb135cf0c26d"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"id":"DXHHhj2jhjjg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679356246005,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# url string that hosts our .csv file\n","url = Ruta + \"datasets/cartwheel/cartwheel.csv\"\n","\n","# Read the .csv file and store it as a pandas Data Frame\n","df = pd.read_csv(url)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E2PGATdIbINm"},"source":["If we want to print the information about th output object type we would simply type the following:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"MWbb703QbINn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679356246006,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}},"outputId":"bb9da12d-85df-49ca-f3ec-d683813c710e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["pandas.core.frame.DataFrame"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}],"source":["type(df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-TrO3YWShjjl"},"source":["# Exploring the content of the data set\n","\n","Use the `shape` method to determine the numbers of rows and columns in a data frame.
